# Dependency Resolution (Container)

This sample demonstrates how to inject a dependency resolution method into Xamarin.Forms, so that an app's dependency injection container has control over the construction and lifetime of custom renderers, effects, and DependencyService implementations.

For more information about this sample, see [Dependency Resolution in Xamarin.Forms](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms/internals/dependency-resolution).
