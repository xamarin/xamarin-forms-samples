TodoParse
=========

This sample demonstrates a Todo list application where the data is stored and accessed from a Parse web service.

The app functionality is:

- View a list of tasks.
- Add, edit, and delete tasks.
- Set a task's status to 'done'.
- Speak the task's name and notes fields.

In all cases the tasks are stored and accessed through a Parse web service.
