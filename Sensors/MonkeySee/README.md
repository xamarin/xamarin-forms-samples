Monkey See
=========

**Monkey See** is a program for Xamarin.Forms that uses the cross-platform [`OrientationSensor`](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/essentials/orientation-sensor?context=xamarin/xamarin-forms) included in Xamarin.Essentials. 

**Monkey See** runs on iOS, Android, and the Universal Windows Platform (UWP), but you'll need to run the program on an actual phone or tablet rather than a simulator. The program shows a 3D monkey that you can view from different angles by rotating your phone in 3D space.

The 3D monkey was created by Vic Wang at [http://vidavic.weebly.com](http://vidavic.weebly.com "Vidavic"). It is loaded, displayed, and manipulated using UrhoSharp 3D.

Xamarin.Forms no longer runs on Windows Phone or Windows 10 Mobile devices, but **Monkey See** _will_ run on a Windows 10 tablet, such as a Surface Pro, and runs best in Tablet Mode. To run in Tablet Mode, all external monitors must be disconnected from the device. Sweep your finger along the right edge of the screen (or press the Notifications icon to the right of the date and time) to display the **Action Center**. Select **Tablet Mode**. Then run the program.
