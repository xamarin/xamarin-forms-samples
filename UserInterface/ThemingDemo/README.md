# Theming

Theming can be implemented in Xamarin.Forms applications by creating a `ResourceDictionary` for each theme, and then loading the resources with the `DynamicResource` markup extension.

This sample demonstrates a Xamarin.Forms application that uses theming, and which allows the theme to be changed at runtime.

For more information about this sample, see [Theming a Xamarin.Forms Application](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms/user-interface/theming/).
